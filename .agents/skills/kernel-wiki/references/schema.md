# Schema Reference

Condensed reference for the wiki's controlled vocabulary and page schemas. Full definitions live in `data/schemas.yaml` (KernelWiki's, unchanged); the sections marked *added here* are this repository's rules, enforced by `scripts/validate.py`.

## Page Types and IDs

Every page has a unique `id` with a type-specific prefix:

| Type | ID Prefix | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| source-pr | `pr-<repo>-<N>` | A PR from a tracked repo with an evidence-backed status (942 of 944 are `merged`; two are `closed` without merge) |
| source-doc | `doc-*` | Official NVIDIA docs, papers |
| source-blog | `blog-*` | Community blog posts, tutorials |
| source-contest | `contest-*` | Competition problems / tracks |
| wiki-hardware | `hw-*` | Blackwell hardware feature pages |
| wiki-technique | `technique-*` | Optimization techniques |
| wiki-kernel | `kernel-*` | Kernel case studies with perf claims |
| wiki-pattern | `pattern-*` | Problem → solution diagnosis |
| wiki-language | `lang-*` | DSL / language guides |
| wiki-migration | `migration-*` | Hopper → Blackwell migration |

## Required Frontmatter by Type

### source-pr

This example is an exact copy of the current `pr-cutlass-2472` frontmatter;
a regression keeps every concrete field synchronized with the source page.

`changed_files_count` is the PR object's authoritative total;
`changed_files_enumerated_count` is the number returned by the REST files
endpoint. `changed_files_listing_complete: false` exposes that endpoint's
3,000-file cap. A capped page whose complete pull diff was independently
evaluated also records `changed_files_evidence_count`,
`changed_files_evidence_complete`, `changed_files_evidence_method:
github-pull-diff`, and `changed_files_evidence_receipt`; its
`upstream_files_sha256` covers those full-diff evidence records.
For an inconclusive `.cu` hunk, that digest also binds the immutable
PR-head complete-file SHA-256, the device-signal verdict, and the exact policy
pattern digest used to derive the verdict. The digest includes that receipt
only while the current policy requires it, so historical enrichment cannot
make a clean live re-derivation hash differently. A filename extension,
tile/warp shape variables, host launch configuration (`gridDim`/`blockDim`),
host-visible template names such as `GemmType`, or host-side `<<<...>>>`
launch syntax alone is not positive kernel-implementation evidence.

For a non-explicit Python path whose changed hunk contains only weak tuning
names such as `block_m` or `num_warps`, retention requires an immutable
complete-file receipt proving a recognized Triton, CuTe DSL, or TileLang
device-kernel construct. Python comments and strings are removed before this
decision. Exact `cpu/` path components are outside the GPU implementation
scope; a mixed PR can still qualify through a separate GPU implementation
path.
`changed_paths` is the displayed/evidence subset, independently qualified by
`changed_paths_complete`.

`merge_sha` is a full 40-hex commit ID required exactly when `status: merged`;
it is omitted for a PR that closed without merge.

## Confidence Levels

- **`verified`**: Requires ≥1 `official-doc` + ≥1 `upstream-code` in sources. Enforced by validator.
- **`measured`** (*added here*): established on this repository's H100. Requires an `evidence_basis` entry of type `benchmark` or `reproduction` whose `source_id` is in the page's `sources`: a `hardware-unit-test` document, a reference-grade template's `STATUS` block (`doc-kernel-design-templates`), or an Agent Note (`note-<stem>`). Enforced by validator.
- **`source-reported`**: Cited by ≥1 authoritative source (paper, major blog, major repo).
- **`inferred`**: Synthesized from multiple sources, no single authoritative one.
- **`experimental`**: Undocumented, PTX tricks, version-sensitive. Include CUDA version.

## Reproducibility Levels

For `wiki-technique`, `wiki-kernel`, `wiki-language`, must be ≥ `snippet`.

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `concept` | Text only |
| `pseudocode` | Language-agnostic algorithm |
| `snippet` | Compilable code fragment (verified by validator) |
| `runnable` | Self-contained buildable example |
| `benchmarked` | Runnable + perf numbers with env metadata |

## Controlled Vocabulary

`data/tags.yaml` is the single source of truth for every controlled value in
`architectures`, `hardware_features`, `techniques`, `kernel_types`, `languages`,
`source_categories`, `confidence`, and `reproducibility`. The validator rejects
values absent from that file. This reference deliberately does not duplicate
the lists, so vocabulary additions and removals cannot leave a stale schema
summary behind.

## Canonical Aliases (from data/aliases.yaml)

When asking about:
- UMMA → canonical tag is `tcgen05`
- Tensor Memory / TMEM → `tmem`
- Cluster Launch Control / CLC → `clc`
- Blackwell → architecture family `blackwell`
- B200 / GB200 → architecture `sm100`
- B300 / GB300 → architecture `sm103`
- Hopper / H100 → architecture `sm90`
- MoE / Mixture of Experts → `moe`
- MLA / Multi-head Latent Attention → `mla`
- GDN / Gated Delta Net → `gated-delta-net`
- NSA / Native Sparse Attention → `sparse-attention`
- WGMMA / wgmma.mma_async → `wgmma`

## Symptoms (*added here*)

`symptoms` on pattern pages come from the `symptoms` list in `data/tags.yaml`: KernelWiki's values plus names spelled after the Nsight Compute sm90 stall reasons and rule names the `ncu-report` skill emits. The validator rejects an unlisted value, so `query.py --symptom` and the by-problem index share the profiler's language.

## Citations (*added here*)

- **Machine constants by tag.** A bracketed `[engine.quantity.scope]` in prose resolves through `hardware-unit-test`'s `constants.py`; the number is never restated on the page. Unresolved tags fail validation.
- **Agent Notes as sources.** `note-<stem>` in `sources` resolves to `.agents/notes/{implemented,proposed,rejected}/**/<stem>.md`.
- **Cross-references and links.** Every `related`, `prerequisites` and `candidate_techniques` id resolves to a page; every relative markdown link resolves on disk.
- Both sibling resolutions degrade to a printed note when the sibling is absent, so the skill stays portable.

## Cross-Reference Fields

- `sources`: list of source IDs whose content backs this wiki page
- `related`: list of wiki page IDs that are topically related
- `prerequisites`: list of wiki page IDs the reader should read first
- `candidate_techniques` (pattern only): list of technique/hw/migration IDs that address the symptoms

## Hopper-First Scope

This wiki is sm90-first: Hopper pages need no relevance field, and the Blackwell pages copied from KernelWiki keep their `blackwell_relevance` field as an optional annotation. The validator no longer requires it in either direction; `architectures:` and `query.py --architecture` are how the two lanes stay apart.

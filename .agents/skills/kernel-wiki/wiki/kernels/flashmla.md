# FlashMLA attention kernels

FlashMLA is DeepSeek's upstream library for dense and token-sparse attention
kernels used by DeepSeek-V3 and V3.2. “MLA” in the repository's support matrix
has different modes: decode uses MQA-shaped latent attention, while its dense
SM100 prefill entry is MHA. Preserve that distinction when comparing kernels.

## Reproducible API boundary

The pinned upstream README gives this decode flow:

```python
tile_scheduler_metadata, num_splits = get_mla_metadata(
    cache_seqlens, s_q * h_q // h_kv, h_kv, h_q, is_fp8, topk
)
o_i, lse_i = flash_mla_with_kvcache(
    q_i, kvcache_i, block_table, cache_seqlens, dv,
    tile_scheduler_metadata, num_splits,
    is_causal, is_fp8_kvcache, indices,
)
```

This is an upstream usage excerpt, not a complete benchmark. Use the repository
tests named by the README and the matching CUDA/toolkit requirements.

## Layout and benchmark boundaries

The documented FP8 decode cache is 656 bytes per token: 512 E4M3 values, four
FP32 scales, and 64 BF16 RoPE values. Sparse decode's indices encode the page
block and within-page offset; invalid values are `-1`.

The retained B200 prefill maxima are 1460 TFLOPS for dense MHA forward and 1450
TFLOPS for sparse MLA forward. They come from different benchmark suites and
must not be interpreted as a controlled dense-versus-sparse comparison.

The former `artifacts/kernels/flashmla` bundle was removed because its files
were sourced from CUTLASS and FlashInfer PRs rather than the FlashMLA repository.

## The sm90 decode structure as a reference

FlashMLA's sm90 decode kernels are a reference for warp-role layout in a
decode-shaped attention kernel, seqlen-split scheduling with a separate
combine pass (`technique-reduction-own-task-kind`), and CuTe wgmma
choreography. Its compact CuTe `sm90::gemm` wrapper is worth reusing as-is
for wgmma choreography rather than re-deriving the descriptor and
commit/wait dance in raw PTX; rewriting it duplicates a proven contract and
makes review harder. The pinned copy this repository reads is the
`third_party/flashmla` submodule at the commit named above.

What usually does not transfer: the dynamic tile scheduler and the head and
paging geometry, since a fixed-shape target compiles its geometry in. Split
and combine economics depend on the query-row count and cache length; price
them per shape (`pattern-fusion-latency-chain`). Its performance claims are
Hopper, but on MLA serving shapes: transfer structure, not numbers.
